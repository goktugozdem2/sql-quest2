# SQL Quest — Claude Instructions

## Design System
Always read `DESIGN.md` before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, border-radius, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.

Enforcement:
- Never introduce a new color outside the `DESIGN.md` palette.
- Never use Inter, Roboto, Poppins, Montserrat, or any blacklisted font.
- The accent color (`#FFE34D`) appears ONLY on primary CTAs, score/XP values, leaderboard medal ranks, streak indicators, and win-state flashes. Never on borders, backgrounds, icons, or decoration.
- The SQL syntax palette (blue keyword / green string / orange number) is brand, not a generic IDE theme.
- In QA or review mode, flag any code that doesn't match `DESIGN.md`.
